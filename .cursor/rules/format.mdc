# Elixir Code Formatting Rules

## Automatic Formatting
Always run `mix format` before committing code. This is enforced by:
1. Git pre-commit hook (automatically runs on commit)
2. Manual execution: `mix format`
3. IDE integration (recommended to format on save)

## Formatting Configuration
- Follow `.formatter.exs` settings
- Line length: 120 characters
- Import dependencies: Phoenix, LiveView
- Includes subdirectories: storybook

## When to Format
- Before every commit (automated)
- After significant code changes
- When code style becomes inconsistent
- Before code reviews

## Bypass (Emergency Only)
If absolutely necessary, bypass with:
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```
**Note:** This should only be used in emergencies and the code should be formatted in the next commit.

## IDE Setup
Configure your editor to:
- Run `mix format` on save
- Show formatting errors inline  
- Use project's `.formatter.exs` configuration
